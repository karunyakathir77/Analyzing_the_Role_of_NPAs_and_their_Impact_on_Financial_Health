# Analyzing_the_Role_of_NPAs_and_their_Impact_on_Financial_Health
## Objective:
This project is to demonstrate the impact of Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) on key financial parameters using various techniques to determine whether NPAs significantly affect the financial health of the bank. The study explores how rising NPAs affect earnings, lending capacity, and financial stability. Since a bank’s core operations revolve around deposits and loans, any disruption in loan repayments (which converts as NPA) can lead to cash flow imbalances.
## Proposed Research Methodology
* Research Design: The research is structured to assess how NPAs influence financial stability, using a systematic plan to collect, analyze, and interpret data.
* Research Method:
    * Quantitative (Analytical) Method: Used to explore relationships and causal effects between parameters emphasizing statistical examination over descriptive detailing.
* Data Collection Method:
    * Secondary Data: The study relies on SBI’s publicly available financial reports and disclosures over a five-year period (FY 2019–20 to FY 2023–24).
* Research Instrument:
    * Company financial reports: Including Balance Sheets, Profit & Loss Statements, and Asset Quality disclosure, are used to derive insights into SBI’s financial health and NPA trends.
## Tools and Techniques Used
* Ratio Analysis
* Correlation Analysis
* Regression Analysis
* Stress Testing
* CAMEL Framework
## Data Analysis
The detailed data analysis, including Ratio Computations, Statistical Analysis, Stress Testing and CAMEL Analysis, is available in the GitHub repository.
## Findings
* SBI has shown improvement in asset quality with declining GNPA and NNPA ratios, reflecting effective credit risk management and better loan recovery mechanisms.
* The increase in Provision Coverage Ratio (PCR) indicates that the bank is more prepared to absorb potential losses from NPAs, reducing overall financial stress.
* High values in Net Profit Margin, Return on Assets (ROA), and Return on Equity (ROE) confirm consistent profitability and robust financial stability.
* Stable growth in advances, along with an optimal Advances-to-Deposit Ratio (ADR), shows efficient lending operations and strong utilization of deposit resources.
* A strong negative correlation between NPAs and profitability as well as advances highlights that rising NPAs reduce earnings and limit credit expansion.
* Stress testing shows that a sharp increase in GNPA leads to significant profit decline or loss, indicating how critical NPA control is for financial stability.
* Regression analysis confirms that increases in NPAs directly lower net profit, reinforcing the need for proactive risk monitoring and management.
* Under the CAMEL framework, SBI scored the highest among public sector banks due to its low NPA ratios, strong earnings, and operational efficiency.
## Suggestions
* Strengthen the early warning system (EWS) to detect stressed accounts and take proactive measures before accounts turn into NPAs.
* Offer restructuring support for viable borrowers facing temporary distress to prevent loans from slipping into the NPA category.
* SBI's performance under the CAMEL framework should be evaluated against both major public and private sector banks to provide a more comprehensive comparison.
* Continue strengthening credit risk management by adopting AI-driven predictive analytics to identify potential loan defaults earlier.
* Optimize cost efficiency by further automating operational processes and reducing manual intervention in routine banking activities.
## Overall Outcomes
The analysis shows that NPAs significantly impact SBI’s profitability, credit growth, and financial stability. Despite improvements in asset quality and provisioning, rising NPAs still pose risks. Correlation and regression confirm a strong negative effect on earnings, highlighting the need for proactive risk management. While SBI performs well under the CAMEL framework, continued focus on credit monitoring, recovery efficiency, and income diversification is essential for sustained growth and resilience.
